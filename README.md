# CS6200 / IS4200: Homework 1

After cloning this repository, you can edit the Jupyter notebook locally or an a hosted platform like Google Colab. Read through the notebook, filling in code and explanations in the blocks starting with "TODO". Note that the last section is only required for CS6200 students.

Whenever you'd like to save your work, and when you are done, make sure to check in and push to GitHub (if working locally) or, in Colab, select "Save a copy to GitHub" in the File menu.
