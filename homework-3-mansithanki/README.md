# CS6200/IS4200: Homework 3

After cloning this repository, you can edit the Jupyter notebook locally or an a hosted platform like Google Colab. Read through the two notebooks `classification.ipynb` and `embeddings.ipynb`, filling in code and explanations in the blocks starting with "TODO". The classification notebook has an extra section for students in CS6200.

Whenever you'd like to save your work, and when you are done, make sure to check in and push to GitHub (if working locally) or, in Colab, select "Save a copy to GitHub" in the File menu.
