        "The default `SimpleSearcher` in pyserini uses a BM25 model. In this final part of the assignment, you should implement a different, and hopefully improved ranking function. To make this easier to implement, you will _re_-rank the top 1000 results for each query that you evaluated above. In other words, rather than retrieving documents from the whole collection, scan through the top 1000 results for each query given by the baseline SimpleSearcher BM25 model and compute a new score for that result. Then re-sort the top-1000 results by your model's score.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may use anything you've learning in this course—or in another course—to build your ranking function. For example, you could implement pseudo-relevance feedback or a relevance model, which would treat the top of each ranked list (e.g., the top 100) as if it were truly relevant and retrain model parameters. You could tune different BM25, query likelihood, or sequential dependence models. You could try to learn different weights or embeddings for different fields in documents. You could use implementations of transformer language models such as [BERT](https://github.com/castorini/anserini-notebooks/blob/master/Pyserini+SciBERT_on_COVID_19_Demo.ipynb) or [SentenceBERT](https://www.sbert.net/examples/training/ms_marco/README.html) to score the compatibility of queries and documents. To be clear, you  don't have to try all of these approaches, nor do you have to try any of them. You are free to try whatever ideas you like.\n",
